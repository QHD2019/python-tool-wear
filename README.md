# Python Interface for Tool Wear Data

This repository contains the tool wear data used in our paper
["A Generalized Method for Featurization of Manufacturing
Signals, with Application to Tool Condition Monitoring"](http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=922857)

We also provide some simple tools for reading and pre-processing the data.

See the Jupyter notebook for details:
```sh
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook vizulaization.ipynb
